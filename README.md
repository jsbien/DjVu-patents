# DjVu-patents
Some quick and dirty notes about DjVu patents. It seems to me that all them expired by now, but I am not sure.

Cf. also https://github.com/jwilk/didjvu/issues/21.

I am not sure which license is appropriate for some texts included in the repository. If you notice a possible copyright violation, please report it in Issues.

I have neither time nor motivation to develop it further :-) Please consider this repository as orphaned. I would be only too happy to transfer the ownership of this repository to an interested person(s).
